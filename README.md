1. 
2. We created a couple routes that allows us to grab information from the user and that shortens
the url and doesn't allow the users to see the actual file, but they see the template.

5. We made sure that we both have a history of commits and that we use clearly commented commits that
make sense.
6. We have two classes that use inheritance relationship. We have a car class and a SUV class and the
SUV class extends and inherits everything from the car class because an SUV has all the same 
characteristics as a car, but more options can be added to the SUV which makes it an inheritance class.

8. We made sure that all the code is not redundant and there are comments above all functions and 
talk about what they do and how they work. 
9. We made sure to put our full efforts and give it the best we can to come up with this website.
